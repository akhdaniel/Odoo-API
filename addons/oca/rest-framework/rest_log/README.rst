especially in case of errors.

This module add DB logging for REST requests.
It also inject in the response the URL of the log entry created.

Up to version 13.0.1.2.1 of this module,
if shopfloor is installed, log records will be copied from its table.

Configuration
=============

Logs retention
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Logs are kept in database for every REST requests made by a client application.
They can be used for debugging and monitoring of the activity.

The Logs menu is shown only with Developer tools (``?debug=1``) activated.

By default, REST logs are kept 30 days.
You can change the duration of the retention by changing the System Parameter
``rest.log.retention.days``.

If the value is set to 0, the logs are not stored at all.

Logged data is: request URL and method, parameters, headers, result or error.


Logs activation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You have 2 ways to activate logging:

* on the service component set `_log_calls_in_db = True`
* via configuration

In the 1st case, calls will be always be logged.

In the 2nd case you can set ``rest.log.active`` param as::

    `collection_name`  # enable for all endpoints of the collection
    `collection_name.usage`  # enable for specific endpoints
    `collection_name.usage.endpoint`  # enable for specific endpoints
    `collection_name*:state`  # enable only for specific state (success, failed)
